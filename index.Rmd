abstract: |
  Researchers and clinicians in neuropsychology often compare individual
  patients against healthy control samples, to quantify evidence for
  cognitive-behavioural deficits and dissociations. Statistical methods for
  these comparisons have been developed that control Type I (false positive)
  errors effectively. However, remarkably little attention has been given to the
  power of these tests. In this practical primer, we describe, in minimally
  technical terms, the origins and limits of power for case-control comparisons.
  We argue that power calculations can play useful roles in single-case study
  design and interpretation, and we make suggestions for optimising power in
  practice. As well as providing figures, tables and tools for estimating the
  power of case-control comparisons, we hope to assist researchers in setting
  realistic expectations for what such tests can achieve in general.
