In this article, we provide some context for this development, from an audit of the Cortex archives. We suggest that single-case research is alive and well, and more rigorous than ever, and that current practice has been shaped considerably by Crawford and colleagues’ statistical reﬁnements over the past 12 years. However, there is scope for further tightening and standardisation of statistical methods and reporting standards. The advantages offered by the new Bayesian tests should promote the even wider use of appropriate statistical methods, with beneﬁts for the validity of individual studies, and for cross-comparability in the single-case literature.},

It is suggested that the t test be used when the N of the normative sample is less than 50. Finally, a computer program that implements the modiﬁed t-test procedure is described.

Monte Carlo simulation was employed to study the statistical power of two competing approaches to this task. The power to detect a large deficit was low to moderate for a method proposed by Crawford and Howell (1998; ranging from 44\% to 63\%) but was extremely low for a method proposed by Mycroft, Mitchell, and Kay (2002; ranging from 1\% to 13\%). The effects of departures from normality were examined, as was the effect of varying degrees of measurement error in the scores of controls and the single case. Measurement error produced a moderate reduction in power when present in both controls and the case; the effect of differentially greater measurement error for the single case depended on the initial level of power. When Mycroft et al.'s method was used to test for the presence of a classical dissociation, it produced very high Type I error rates (ranging from 20.7\% to 49.3\%); in contrast, the rates for criteria proposed by Crawford and Garthwaite (2005b) were low (ranging from 1.3\% to 6.7\%).

When used as signiﬁcance tests, the two remaining methods (Crawford and Howell’s method and a prediction interval method ﬁrst used by Barton and colleagues) are also equivalent and achieve control of the Type I error rate (the two methods do differ however in other important aspects). A number of broader issues also arise from the present ﬁndings, namely: (a) they underline the value of accompanying signiﬁcance test results with the effect size for the difference between a case and controls, (b) they suggest that less care is often taken over statistical methods than over other aspects of single-case studies, and (c) they indicate that some neuropsychologists have a distorted conception of the nature of hypothesis testing in single-case research (it is argued that this may stem from a failure to distinguish between group studies and single-case studies).},

	abstract = {In contrast to the careful consideration given to the issue of what we can infer from dissociations in single-case studies, the more basic question of how we decide whether a dissociation is present has been relatively neglected. Proposals are made for fully operational definitions of a deficit, classical and strong dissociations, and double dissociations. In developing these definitions it was assumed that they should be based on the use of inferential rather than descriptive statistical methods. The scope of these definitions is limited to typical single-case studies in which patients are compared to control samples of a modest size. The operational definition of a classical dissociation incorporates a requirement that a patient’s performance on Task X is significantly different from Task Y, in addition to the “standard” requirement that the patient has a deficit on Task X and is within normal limits on Task Y. We ran a simulation to estimate the Type I error rates when the criteria for dissociations are applied and found these to be low (Type I errors were defined as identifying an individual from the control population as having a dissociation). The inferential methods for testing whether the various criteria are met make use of t-distributions. These methods are contrasted with the widespread use of z to test for a deficit or a difference between tasks. In the latter approach the statistics of the control sample are treated as parameters; this is not appropriate when, as is normally the case, the control sample size is modest in size.},

Extending work on classical dissociations, Monte Carlo simulation is used to examine the Type I error rate for two methods of detecting strong dissociations. When a Type I error was deﬁned as misclassifying a healthy control, error rates were low for both methods. When Type I errors were deﬁned as misclassifying patients with strictly equivalent deﬁcits on two tasks, error rates for strong dissociations were high for the “conventional” criteria and were very high when cases misclassiﬁed as exhibiting either form of dissociation (strong or classical) were combined (maximum = 55.1\%). The power to detect strong and classical dissociations was generally low-to-moderate, but was moderate-to-high in most scenarios when power was deﬁned as the ability to detect either form of dissociation. In most scenarios patients with strong dissociations were more likely to be classiﬁed as exhibiting classical dissociations.

Moreover, there is a large reservoir of published data that could be used to build regression equations; these equations could then be employed to test a wide variety of hypotheses concerning the functioning of individual cases. This resource is currently underused because (a) not all psychologists are aware that regression equations can be built not only from raw data but also using only basic summary data for a sample, and (b) the computations involved are tedious and prone to error. In an attempt to overcome these barriers, Crawford and Garthwaite (2007) provided methods to build and apply simple linear regression models using summary statistics as data. In the present study, we extend this work to set out the steps required to build multiple regression models from sample summary statistics and the further steps required to compute the associated statistics for drawing inferences concerning an individual case. We also develop, describe, and make available a computer program that implements these methods. Although there are caveats associated with the use of the methods, these need to be balanced against pragmatic considerations and against the alternative of either entirely ignoring a pertinent data set or using it informally to provide a clinical “guesstimate.” Upgraded versions of earlier programs for regression in the single case are also provided; these add the point and interval estimates of effect size developed in the present article.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the standard use of regression, in which an individual’s score on the dependent variable is unknown, neuropsychologists are often interested in comparing a predicted score with a known obtained score. Existing inferential methods use the standard error for a new case (sNϩ1) to provide conﬁdence limits on a predicted score and hence are tailored to the standard usage. However, sNϩ1 can be used to test whether the discrepancy between a patient’s predicted and obtained scores was drawn from the distribution of discrepancies in a control population. This method simultaneously provides a point estimate of the percentage of the control population that would exhibit a larger discrepancy. A method for obtaining conﬁdence limits on this percentage is also developed. These methods can be used with existing regression equations and are particularly useful when the sample used to generate a regression equation is modest in size. Monte Carlo simulations conﬁrm the validity of the methods, and computer programs that implement them are described and made available.},

In contrast, the combination of leptokurtosis and skew produced marked inﬂation of error rates for small Ns.

In neuropsychological applications the most common method of making inferences concerning the difference between an individual’s test score and the score predicted by a regression equation is to multiply the standard error of estimate by an appropriate value of z to form conﬁdence limits around the predicted score. The technically correct method is to calculate the standard error of a new individual Y and multiply it by the value of t corresponding to the desired limits (e.g., 90\% or 95\%).

These criteria require a patient to show a frank deﬁcit on one task (for a classical dissociation) or both tasks (for a strong dissociation), and a signiﬁcantly extreme difference between tasks. I propose that only the signiﬁcant betweentask difference is logically necessary, and that if this simple criterion is met, the patient should be said to show a dissociation. Using Monte Carlo simulations, I show that this simpliﬁcation increases the power to detect dissociations across a range of practicallyrelevant conditions, whilst retaining excellent control over Type I error. Additional testing for frank deﬁcits on each task provides further qualifying information, but using these test outcomes to categorise dissociations as classical or strong may be too uncertain to guide theoretical inferences reliably. I suggest that we might instead characterise the strength of the dissociation using a continuous index, such as the effect size of the between-task difference.},

Extending earlier work by Sokal and Rohlf (1995) and Crawford and Howell (in press), we developed a modiﬁed paired samples t test as an alternative to this formula. Unlike the Payne and Jones formula, the new method treats data from a normative or control sample as sample statistics rather than as population parameters. Technically, the new method is more appropriate for any comparison of an individual’s difference score against normative data. However, it is most useful when the normative data is derived from samples with modest Ns; in these circumstances the Payne and Jones method overestimates the abnormality of differences. We suggest that the modiﬁed t test can be a useful tool in clinical practice and in single-case research. A computer program is made available that automates the calculations involved and can be used to store relevant data for future use.},

The most famous of these illusions is the ‘size–weight illusion’, where a small object feels heavier than an identically weighted, but otherwise similar-looking, larger object. There are, however, a variety of similar illusions which can be induced by varying other stimulus properties, such as surface material, temperature, colour, and even shape. Despite well over 100 years of research, there is little consensus about the mechanisms underpinning these illusions. In this review, I will first provide an overview of the weight illusions that have been described. I will then outline the dominant theories that have emerged over the past decade for why we consistently misperceive the weights of objects which vary in size, with a particular focus on the role of lifters’ expectations of heaviness. Finally, I will discuss the magnitude of the various weight illusions and suggest how this largely overlooked facet of the topic might resolve some of the debates surrounding the cause of these misperceptions of heaviness.},

The broad pattern of results confirms that S.B., like the extensively tested patient D.F., shows an impressive array of preserved skills, despite his severe perceptual problems. Also like D.F., S.B. shows certain subtle visuomotor difficulties that can be related to the idea that his partially intact occipito-parietal areas are unable to benefit from interactions with the apparently severely damaged occipito-temporal regions. Unlike D.F., however, he is able to make accurate discriminations of simple visual features, such as object width and orientation, albeit with very slow response times. We hypothesize that several factors such as the early onset of S.B.’s lesion and the long period since his brain lesion have allowed his brain to compensate to a degree what has been impossible in D.F., whose brain damage occurred in adulthood. This may include an element of ‘rewiring’ and self-monitoring of visuomotor processes that allow S.B. to achieve perceptual access to visual information processed in the dorsal stream: information that is normally only available for on-line visuomotor control.},

	abstract = {The size-weight illusion is a perceptual illusion where smaller objects are judged as heavier than equally weighted larger objects. A previous informal report suggests that visual form agnosic patient DF does not experience the size-weight illusion when vision is the only available cue to object size. We tested this experimentally, comparing the magnitudes of DF’s visual, kinesthetic and visual-kinesthetic size-weight illusions to those of 28 similarly-aged controls. A modified t-test found that DF’s visual size-weight illusion was significantly smaller than that of controls (zcc = −1.7). A test of simple dissociation based on the Revised Standardized Difference Test found that the discrepancy between the magnitude of DF’s visual and kinesthetic size-weight illusions was not significantly different from that of controls (zdcc = −1.054), thereby failing to establish a dissociation between the visual and kinesthetic conditions. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that visual form agnosia, following ventral visual stream damage, is associated with an abnormally reduced size-weight illusion. The results, however, do not confirm that this reduction is specific to the use of visual size cues to predict object weight, rather than reflecting more general changes in the processing of object size cues or in the use of predictive strategies for lifting.},

	abstract = {Introduction  Recent evidence has implicated the precuneus of the medial parietal lobe as one of the first brain areas to show pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Damage to the precuneus through focal brain injury is associated with impaired visually guided reaching, particularly for objects in peripheral vision. This raises the hypothesis that peripheral misreaching may be detectable in patients with prodromal AD. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency and severity of peripheral misreaching in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Methods and analysis  Patients presenting with amnestic MCI, mild-t­o-m­ oderate AD and healthy older-­adult controls will be tested (target N=24 per group). Peripheral misreaching will be assessed using two set-u­ ps: a tablet-­based task of lateral reaching and motion-­tracked radial reaching (in depth). There are two versions of each task, one where participants can look directly at targets (free reaching), another wheren they must maintain central fixation (peripheral reaching). All tasks will be conducted first on their dominant, and then their non-­ dominant side. For each combination of task and side, a Peripheral Misreaching Index (PMI) will be calculated as the increase in absolute reaching error between free and peripheral reaching. Each patient will be classified as showing peripheral misreaching if their PMI is significantly abnormal, by comparison to control performance, on either side of space. We will then test whether the frequency of peripheral misreaching exceeds the chance level in each patient group and compare the overall severity of misreaching between groups. Ethics and dissemination  Ethical approval was provided by the National Health Service (NHS) East of England, Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (REC 19/ EE/0170). The results of this study will be published in a peer-­reviewed journal and presented at academic conferences.},
