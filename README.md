# Abstract

Researchers and clinicians in neuropsychology often compare individual
patients against healthy control samples, to quantify evidence for
cognitive-behavioural deficits and dissociations. Statistical methods for
these comparisons have been developed that control Type I (false positive)
errors effectively. However, remarkably little attention has been given to the
power of these tests. In this practical primer, we describe, in minimally
technical terms, the origins and limits of power for case-control comparisons.
We argue that power calculations can play useful roles in single-case study
design and interpretation, and we make suggestions for optimising power in
practice. As well as providing figures, tables and tools for estimating the
power of case-control comparisons, we hope to assist researchers in setting
realistic expectations for what such tests can achieve in general.
